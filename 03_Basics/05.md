How code executes ??

* execution context
 
    |-> when we create javascript it creates an global execution context and it will be stored in a variable called "THIS"

    |-> It executes in the thread , single thread .

    |-> Execution conetext 
            -> Global execution context 
            -> functional execution context 
            -> Eval execution context 
    

    JavaScript run into two phases 
        ->  memory creation phase ( space allocated to varibale but does not executed inShort memory allocation )
        ->  execution phase 


    example : 

    let var1=5
    let var2=10

    function addnum (num1 , num2){
        let total = num1+num2
        return total
    }

    console.log(addnum (var1 , var2))
    console.log(addnum (1 ,2))


|-----> Step 1 :  global execution and it is allocated into this variable 
|
|       step 2 :  memory phase ( var1 (undefined) , var2 (undefined) , addnum (defination) , result1 (undefined) , result2 (undefined))
|
|       step 3 :  execution phase 
|
|   ( 
|       * var1 (10)) , 
|       * var2 (5) , 
|       * addnum () whenever the function executed everytime it create a new execution context it creates a sandbox and new thread and
|         it will again executes the phase that is memory phase and execute phase after completion it will be deleted automatically ,
|
|       * memory phase ( new sand box ) 
|           ** val1 ( undefined) 
|           ** val2 ( undefined)
|           ** total  ( undefined ) 
|       * execution context (new san box )
|           ** num1 (10)
|           ** num2 (5)
|            ** total ( 15 )
|            ** total ( 15 )
|
|----------------------------total value will be return to the global execution context 

        * again for the result2 ( it will create a new sand box i:e memory phase , execution phase and it will work same)



* Call Stacks

                |                   |
                |                   |
                |                   |
                |                   |
                |                   |
                |                   |
                |                   |
                |                   |
                |                   |
                |                   |
                |-------------------|  <-- global execution 
                 --------------------


        call stack uses LIFO concept
